# İbrahim BABAL

Hi! I’m İbrahim.
I started programming as a backend developer using Python-Django and NodeJS. While
creating Full-stack apps I find myself enjoying more on the Frontend side so I become a
Frontend developer. Working on both sides gave me a great understanding of how the
Internet works. I applied myself to the ”T” model developer. Where I specialize in
Frontend, I also know the essentials of other sides of software development.
